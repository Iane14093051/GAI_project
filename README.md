## Course Synopsis

This course provides an overview of the fundamental theories behind generative AI, covering various generative models for both text and images. It also includes practical exercises for applying these concepts in real-world scenarios.


## Description of labs

The overview provided here is quite brief; please refer to the PDF files and the code within each directory for more detailed information.

[Project2a](https://github.com/Iane14093051/GAI_project1-3/tree/main/E14093051_GAI_Project2a) :
- The goal of this project is to develop an arithmetic text generation model using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or similar architectures such as GRU or LSTM.
  
[Project2b](https://github.com/Iane14093051/GAI_project1-3/tree/main/E14093051_GAI_Project2b) :
- The objective of this project is to develop a text summarization model utilizing a transformer-based architecture. This involves adapting the provided T5 English text generation code and employing GPT-2 for Chinese text summarization.

[Project3](https://github.com/Iane14093051/GAI_project1-3/tree/main/E14093051_GAI_Project3) :
- The objective of this project is to explore Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques using the GLUE benchmark datasets to enhance model performance on various natural language processing tasks.
